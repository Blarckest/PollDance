This project was made in 4h to allow someone to make a poll where people can put opinion on a subject and vote on others opinion. The project was created so that my class could share its opinions on the courses we had (class council). The previous method we used was a Google Form, but it was too time-consuming. This is my solution to that problem.


The project is not made to have maintenable code nor is conceived with security in mind, use at your own risk (i was short on time when i made it)


Confidentiality:


- opinion: untraceable


- grade: owner can find out who gave a grade with a bit of effort.



A dockerfile is provided
